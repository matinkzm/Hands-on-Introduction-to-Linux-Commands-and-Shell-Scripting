# Hands-on-Introduction-to-Linux-Commands-and-Shell-Scripting
This is the final project for introduction to linux commands and shell scripting course in coursera.
In this project I use shell script to store the files that created within the last 24 hours in an array.
first set destination and target directories to variables and calculate today and yesterday time in seconds. then create an array and search for any files between today and yesterday time. after that
I saved it in the array and move it to the destination directory. :)
